# Conference-Zhou

Conference-Zhou is a java program aimed to assist in the organization of Conferences
by registering attendees through pre-registration (in the form of a txt file) and
manual registration. Furthermore, it assigns attendees to tables so that no attendee
is at the same table as someone else in their company. In addition to this core functionality,
it allows users to complete various supplementary actions as follows:

- print the table of individual IDs (rows being Conference tables and columns being seats)
- print the table of First Names (rows being Conference tables and columns being seats)
- search for an attendee's info
- grab a table's info
- get a company's roster

This program is especially relevant to ensure seamless organization of conferences. 
The placement of attendees such that no two are at the same table encourages the sharing
of diverse ideas to boost effectiveness of the conference.

The program itself includes javadoc headers, multi-line comments for methods & classes, and
single line comments describing difficult areas when programming and sources.


Jason Zhou is the creator of Conference-Zhou.
Conference-Zhou was created in 2025 within the context of the AP CSA class at 
The Seven Hills School, taught by Mr. Marcus Twyford.
